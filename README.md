## What is it

Nuvio One M puts four things in one phone and tablet app:

1. **[Nuvio Mobile](https://github.com/NuvioMedia/NuvioMobile):** the home screen, addons, Trakt and Simkl, your Nuvio account and Nuvio's player.
2. **Music:** Home, Explore, Library, Local, Search, Party and integrations, with background playback.
3. **IPTV:** Live TV, Sports, Calendar, recordings and On Demand, from [NuvioPlusIPTV](https://github.com/homelessbrian/NuvioPlusIPTV) by homelessbrian, brought over to the phone.
4. **OneTube:** a YouTube section of its own, played in the same player.

It's the phone companion to the **[Nuvio + IPTV + 1Tube TV app](https://github.com/zoga2o3-ops/NuvioPlusIPTV-1T)**, and the two share your Live TV setup through Google Drive. It has its own package name, so it installs next to the official Nuvio app.

## What you get

**Music**
- Home, Explore, Library, Local and Search, with background playback that keeps going when you leave the app.
- Queue, lyrics, Up Next, likes, playlists, radio and downloads.
- WebDAV and Navidrome servers, local and USB music, plus Google Drive uploads.
- Party mode with a guest QR, Last.fm and Spotify integrations.
- Layouts for phone portrait, phone landscape and tablet.

**Live TV**
- M3U links, Xtream logins and Stalker portals (portal address and MAC), XMLTV guides, several at once, each one editable and switchable.
- List or grid channels, a guide grid, your own groups, copy channels between groups, rename, renumber, change logos, hide, favorites and recents.
- Search by channel, or by programme to see what's on now or soon.
- Catch-up replay (where your provider supports it), a pause and rewind buffer, a backup channel if one drops, captions, passthrough audio and frame-rate matching.
- Swipe up or down in the picture to change channel, an in-player channel list, quality badges, reminders and a sleep timer.
- A parental PIN for groups, with a setting for how long they stay unlocked.
- Playlist repair, so provider streams with small faults still play.

**Recording**
- Record now, schedule from the guide, record a whole series, keep the last N, and resume where you left off.

**On Demand**
- Your provider's movies and series as rows, with search, genres, sorting, several versions of a title and an episode picker.
- Continue watching on Home, show or hide, rename, reorder and lock groups, and Fix poster.
- "Watch On Demand" shows up in Nuvio's own stream list.

**Sports**
- Scores by day and league, My Teams, league tables, game details, which of your channels carry a game, a video window on the page, record a game, reminders for the teams you follow, and an optional switch to the game when it starts.

**Calendar**
- Upcoming, recently aired, airing today and Following, movie release dates for your Library, "On my TV" (where your channels carry a show), a bell on a show's page, and a New episodes row on Home.

**OneTube**
- A YouTube tab that needs no account: browse, search, captions, chat and SponsorBlock, with sound tracks that start on the original language.

**Casting**
- Google Cast from the shared player: movies, series, live channels and YouTube.

**Everywhere**
- Search shows matching channels, shows on now and On Demand titles next to Nuvio's results, and Home gets Live TV, New episodes and On Demand rows.
- Simkl signs in with a code. Signing out of Nuvio also clears Live TV and the Drive link.
- **Google Drive sync:** back up and restore your Live TV setup between your phone and your TV, with your own Drive.

## Known rough edges

- Not every phone and tablet has been tried, so other devices may behave differently.
- Casting has only been tried with a limited set of Cast devices. Some streams can't be cast, such as the phone's own P2P server or local files.
- Recording, "On my TV", auto-switch to a game, protected (DRM) channels have had the least testing.
- Stalker portals have only been tried against a test portal. Movies and series, catch-up and portals that ask for a login are not supported, and recording, the pause buffer and casting are the least tested with them.

## Install

Download the APK for your phone from the [Releases](https://github.com/zoga2o3-ops/Nuvio-One-M/releases) page. Most phones need `arm64-v8a`. After that the app updates itself (Settings → About).

## Getting started

1. Open the app and sign in with your Nuvio account, or continue without one.
2. Go to **Live TV → Sources** and add an M3U link or Xtream login, plus a guide if you have one.
3. The OneTube tab works straight away. To cast, press the Cast button in the player.

## Reporting bugs and asking for features

Please check the [existing issues](https://github.com/zoga2o3-ops/Nuvio-One-M/issues) first, then open a new one with your phone model, the app version and what you did. Problems that also happen in the official app belong with [Nuvio](https://github.com/NuvioMedia/NuvioMobile/issues).
